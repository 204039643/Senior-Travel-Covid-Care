Welcome to Senior Covid Care Application:
The state of today's public health environment was the inspriration for our application of Senior COVID Care. Our application's target demographic is senior citizens who are traveling (e.g. snowbirds, visiting children out-of-state) and may have been exposed or developed symptoms of COVID and need to find a physician. Users can search based on the type of practice, geolocation plus a hard coded search, and the gender of the practicing physician. A goal of this application was to be as user-friendly as possible with our target user in mind.

Installation:

1. APIs were identified that would be appropriate for this application.
2. AJAX calls were developed related to those APIs.
3. A main.html page was hard-coded including search criteria. Search information is linked to the search button which takes the user to the results page of the application.
4. A search result div was dynamically populated via the script.js sheet.
